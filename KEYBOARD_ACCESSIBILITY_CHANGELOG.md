# Keyboard Accessibility Improvements

## Summary
Enhanced the feedback form and chatbot interface with comprehensive keyboard navigation support, including checkbox keyboard navigation, improved styling consistency, and resolved focus persistence issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Checkbox Keyboard Navigation
- **Added full keyboard support for checkbox questions** in feedback flow
- **Arrow key navigation** between checkboxes and the "Next" button
- **Enter/Space key selection** for checkboxes and next button progression
- **Visual focus indicators** matching regular option styling
- **Screen reader announcements** for checkbox state changes

### 2. Focus Management Improvements
- **Resolved focus persistence issue** where previous question elements remained keyboard navigable
- **Message-based element filtering** - only elements in the most recent message respond to keyboard events
- **Automatic focus cleanup** when new content appears
- **Proper tabindex management** to prevent old elements from being navigable

### 3. Visual Styling Consistency
- **Unified styling** between checkbox elements and regular options
- **Consistent hover effects** with transform and box-shadow
- **Matching typography** (font-size: 14px, font-weight: 400)
- **Identical border radius** (6px) and padding (8px 12px)
- **Centered content alignment** for next button with flexbox

### 4. Enhanced Feedback Form
- **Added new questions** to feedback flow:
  - Primary role selection with "Other" option
  - Community interest multi-select checkboxes
  - Custom role input when "Other" is selected
- **Improved optional field handling** for ACCESS ID fields
- **Auto-fill functionality** for empty string submission
